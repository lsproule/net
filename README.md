# Time protocols
Q: A file server on the network is receiving synchronized time so that it can communicate properly, however it cannot provide synchronized time for other devices on the network. Why is this?

A: The server supports only SNTP (Simple Network Time Protocol)


# Statistics
Q: An organization is using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for remote management and monitoring of servers and network appliances and must deploy an agent to each device.
Where are the statistics relating to the activity of each device kept?

A:
MIB (Management Information Base)



# Syslog alert codes
Q:
An organization is using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for remote management and monitoring of servers and network appliances and must deploy an agent to each device. Where are the statistics relating to the activity of each device kept?

A:
Critical


# Environmental Issues

Q: An organization is designing a new data center. What types of environmental issues should the organization implement sensors for?

A:
1. Tempurature
2. Humidity
3. Electrical


# OSI Model

Q: A communications engineer notices that every time it rains the signal becomes very degraded. Which layer of the OSI model is the engineer most likely troubleshooting?

A: Data-link (responsible for transferring data between nodes on the same logical segment)

Q: A security engineer configures software-based port security on a hardware firewall. Which OSI model layer identifies the application ports to configure?

A: Network Layer (Layer 3) the routing part of the router (such as a SOHO router), makes forwarding decisions between the local private network and the public Internet.

# Ethernet cabling

Q: A network technician in Germany is setting up Cat 7 cabling in the organization's environment. The technician should, to comply with installation standards, terminate the cabling with what type of connector?
A:
1. TERA
2. GG45

Q: A network technician needs a cost-effective solution that can multiplex up to 16 wavelengths on an SFP/SFP+ interface. Which multiplexing technique should the network technician use?

A: Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM) supports up to 16 wavelengths and typically deploys four or eight bidirectional channels over a single fiber strand.

Q: A network technician is laying out coax cables and needs to order more termination connectors. What should the technician order?

A: F-type

Q: A technician who lays cabling is researching how the manufacturer constructed fiber optic cabling. Which of the following reflects signals back into the waveguide as efficiently as possible so that the light
signal travels along the waveguide by multiple internal reflections?

A: Cladding

Q: A company calls a consultant to replace STP cabling and is looking at the varying types. Which of the following is the most challenging to install?

A: Legacy shielded twisted pair (STP) cable could be complex to install, as it requires bonding each element to ground manually. Using screened or shielded cable means the consultant must also use screened/shielded connectors. 

Q: A network cabling engineer reviews different fiber optic connector form factors. Which of the following features a push-pull mechanism that is commonly used with multimode fiber?

A: The Subscriber Connector (SC) is a popular type of fiber optic connector that has a square snap-in design. 
It features a push-pull coupling mechanism, which allows for easy insertion and removal of the connector. 
The SC connector is available in both single-mode and multimode versions, making it versatile for various fiber optic applications.

Q: A network administrator is setting up cabling between buildings and needs to transmit the maximum distance possible. Which type of cabling would be most suitable?

A: Single Mode (SMF) fiber optic cable supports higher bandwidth over longer links than copper cable. Single mode allows for longer distance transmission than MultiMode.

Q: A new network engineer is deploying an architecture using Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD). How does the CSMA/CD protocol work?

A: The following steps are the correct order of a CSMA/CD protocol: Data, check network, transmit data, collision, wait, retransmit.

Q: A project manager is ordering equipment to set up fiber cabling in a new building. Which of the following tools will allow a more permanent join with lower insertion loss?

A: Fusion splicer achieves a more permanent join with lower insertion loss (>=0.1 dB). The fusion splicing machine performs a precise alignment between the two strands and then permanently joins them together.

Q: A project manager is preparing for an upcoming work assignment and is comparing available cable types for use within the project. What is NOT a benefit of using fiber optic cabling?

A: Cost
